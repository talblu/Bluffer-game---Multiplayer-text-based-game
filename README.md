General Description:

This project is an implementation of a text-based game server (JAVA) and client (C++). The communication between the server and the client(s) will be performed using a simple text based protocol (TBGP), which can potentially support different games; However, this server will only support a single game - Bluffer.
The implementation of the server is based on the Reactor and Thread-Per-Client servers, adjusted to support more complex protocols. Also, in this project is the implementation of the TBGP, and finally, the addition of support for the Bluffer game in the server, and the implementation of a C++ client.
